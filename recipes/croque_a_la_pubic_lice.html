    <img src="../images/Croque_monsieur.jpg" width="360">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For when you got the itchy bugs in your downstairs hairs. Shares its name with a certain crustacean.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread I think. Maybe an egg.</li>
        <li>Your disgusting house guests.</li>
        <li>Whatever goes into a croque monsieur or whatever.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Make the dish this is ruining. Follow another recipe, I don't know how it's done.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on your gross little friends. They must be alive when they join the dish but it doesn't matter if they die once they hit it. If it's too difficult to get them individually just bosh some clumps of pubes on that bad boy.</li>
        <li>Et voila! Now you can share your dirty little secret with everyone you know. Right in their mouth hole. Damn, should've said pie hole.</li>
    </ol>
